# NunjucksAspNetMvc

Project is a **proof of concept** demonstrating how a JavaScript templating language (in this case, Nunjucks) 
could be used to render templates from within AspNet MVC.

## Notable

* This is running on .NET Framework, _not_ .NET Core.
* Leverages the _NodeServices_ package by Microsoft
* Approach could be used for any JS templating language which is invoked by Node.

Please note that this project is purely for testing and demonstration purposes. Code is not designed or intended for use in production.
There are many concerns which haven't benn, and likely will not be, addressed in this codebase.
